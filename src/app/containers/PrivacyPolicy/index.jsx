          with Alberta’s{" "}
          <strong>Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA)</strong>, the
          federal <strong>Canadian Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL)</strong>, and

        <SectionTitle>Marketing Emails</SectionTitle>
        <Paragraph>
          From time to time, we may send promotional offers to customers who
          have opted into our marketing communications. We share your dislike
          for spam and promise to keep these emails infrequent, relevant, and
          valuable. If you wish to receive marketing emails, you can opt in by
          checking the appropriate box when requesting a quote. By participating
          in our online contests, you are also opting into our marketing emails.
          You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of
          any marketing email.

        <SectionTitle>Transactional Emails</SectionTitle>
        <Paragraph>
          We collect only the personal information necessary to provide our
          services to you. This typically includes your name, contact details
          (email and phone number), and details about the service you require
          (e.g., vehicle information and, in some cases, your address). We
          usually collect this information directly from you, but we may also
          collect it from other sources with your consent or as permitted by
          law.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          We will always explain why we need your personal information before or
          at the time of collection, except in cases where the purpose is
          obvious (e.g., when you voluntarily provide your information in a
          quote request).
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          By submitting a request for a quote, you consent (as required by CASL)
          to us using your information to fulfill your request. This may include
          sharing a portion of your information (typically vehicle details) with
          third-party vendors as needed.
        </Paragraph>
